<h4>
Next Step: Developing a Vermont Conservation Strategy for Pollinators
</h4>
</div>

To effectively respond to heightened conservation concerns for wild bees and other pollinators, we will spearhead the development and implementation of a statewide plan for the conservation of Vermontâ€™s pollinators with a coalition of partners, including scientists, natural resource managers, decision makers, conservation planners, funders, and others. The plan will be a broad-based, scientifically-sound approach that incorporates needed research, population monitoring, management actions, and education and outreach. The plan of action will provide a framework to guide initiatives across Vermont. By working together with a diverse group of stakeholders, we will help shape a landscape where wild bees and other pollinators can flourish and continue to provide vital ecosystem services now and for future generations.
<br>
The plan will have broad goals with specific action items that will be completed in a 5-year timeframe. These goals will include:

<ul>
<li>Make Vermont's landscapes more pollinator friendly by working with farmers, public land managers, home owners, and others to help implement important management actions.</li>
<li>Help beekeepers achieve healthy, sustainable populations, and ensure honey bees are part of a cohesive pollinator message that balances managed and wild pollinator populations.</li>
<li>Conserve rare native bees and other pollinators by improving our knowledge and by raising awareness through dedicated initiatives, and protecting as much wild pollinator diversity as possible.</li>
<li>Address important knowledge gaps through research and conduct population monitoring of certain species and locations to help track our progress.</li>
<ul>
