<h5> Apis Exclusion Zones </h5>
<div class = "row">
<div class="doubleColumn">
<div>
Very few areas of the state are outside the foraging range of honey bees. Given the significant concern around pathogen spillover and direct competition, these areas should be preserved as honey bee free through exclusion areas where no new hives are allowed. The remote nature of these sites should make this a politically feasible endeavor, though it will likely take some significant education and outreach efforts.

<h5> Conserving regionally important habitats </h5>

Active and recently abandoned sandpits are home to perhaps the greatest concentration of rare and unusual bees. They are also rarely conserved and their existence on the landscape is largely dependent on the financial considerations of the many different owners and operators. Well-intentioned solar projects that cap and seed abandon sandpits could quickly remove critical nesting habitat for a number of species that rely on those sand deposits. A conservation mechanism that allows for the continued and regulated extraction of sand while providing financial stability for all stakeholders would potentially help secure the future of the specialist bees and other sand-associated taxa (Sand Martins, Tiger Beetles, etc).
