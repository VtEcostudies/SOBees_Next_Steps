Very few areas of the state are outside the foraging range of honey bees. Given the significant concern around pathogen spillover and direct competition, these areas should be preserved as honey bee free through exclusion areas where no new hives are allowed. The remote nature of these sites should make this a politically feasible endeavor, though it will likely take some significant education and outreach efforts.
