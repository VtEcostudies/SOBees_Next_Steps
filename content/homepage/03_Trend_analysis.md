Robust data on population trends is crucial for identifying species of conservation concern and assessing the impact of restoration efforts. However, the systematic surveys needed to generate this data have only been done for a select number of taxa (primarily bombus) and within the past decade. Though pitfalls and biases exist, there is potential to analyze trends from haphazard collecting and community science observations. This work is ongoing, but will benefit from additional occurrence records, both contemporary and historical (primarily via museum records).
