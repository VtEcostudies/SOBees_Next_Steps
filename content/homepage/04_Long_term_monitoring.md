  Among the roughly 125 bee species known from New England, but not yet recorded in Vermont, are a number of rare species that would be of high
  conservation priority if they do occur here
  </h5>

<h5>Establish long-term monitoring for <i>Bombus</i> and other visually identifiable species</h5>

Long-term monitoring of all 350+ bees in the state would be nearly impossible and prohibitively expensive. Many species however can be monitored without collecting and thus can serve as bellwethers. In particular, bumble bees can be affordably surveyed by trained volunteers at large enough spatial and temporal scales to allow for statistical assessments.


<h5>Survey for species of regional conservation concern</h5>

Macropis Cuckoo Bee (<i>Epeoloides pilosula</i>) and the Ciliate Yellow Loosestrife Bee <i>Macropis ciliata</i> are both Loosestrife associated species that have been found recently at several sites in Massachusetts. Whorled Loosestrife (Lysimachia quadrifolia) on dry, hot powerline Right-Of-Ways would be the most likely habitat for Ciliate Yellow Loosestrife Bee and any nest aggregation of <i>Macropis</i> could support the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, which is so rare it was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in the early 2000â€™s.

In the same family with <i>Macropis</i>, the genus <i>Melitta</i> contains three specialists of conservation concern that could occur in Veromnt. The Blueberry Blunt-horn (<i>Melitta americana</i>) is a specialist on cranberries, primarily American Cranberry (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>). Deerberry Blunt-horn (<i>Melitta eickworti</i>) uses Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) which is known from one site in southwest Vermont in 2021.  The Lyonia Blunt-horn (<i>Melitta melittoides</i>) is a Maleberry (<i>Lyonia ligustrina</i>) specialist that is abundant at one site in Vermont near the Massachusetts border. Both the Blueberry Blunt-Horn and Lyonia Blunt-horn are hosts to the parasitic bee, <i>Nomada rodecki</i>.

At least two mining bees are known from adjacent states and of conservation concern. <i>Andrena uvulariae</i> is a Bellwort  (<i>Uvularia</i> sp.) specialist that should occur in Vermont, though could be easy to overlook given its small size. <i>Andrena rehni</i> is a Chestnut (<i>Castanea</i>) specialist that almost certainly was in Vermont before the arrival of chestnut blight, and may still occur in chestnut orchards or surviving wild trees.

<h5>Research and monitoring of emerging threats</h5>

Capacity building is needed so emerging threats can quickly be identified, assessed, and mitigated. Introduced species, both managed and unmanaged, are a likely source of novel threats, and will continue to be a concern. Programs that monitor, and ideally regulate, the importation of non-apis bees is urgently needed. In addition, a disease monitoring effort to inventory and assess current and future disease risks is needed. Lastly, identification and mitigation of parasites that affect bee communities around the region are needed.

<h5>Estimating population trends</h5>

Robust data on population trends is crucial for identifying species of conservation concern and assessing the impact of restoration efforts. However, the systematic surveys needed to generate these data have only been done for a select number of taxa (primarily <i>Bombus</i>) and began within the past decade. Though pitfalls and biases exist, there is potential to analyze trends from opportunistic specimen collecting and community science observations. This work is ongoing, and will benefit from additional contemporary and historical occurrence records.
