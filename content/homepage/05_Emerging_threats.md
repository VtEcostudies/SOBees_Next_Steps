Despite the current excitement about “saving the bees” the public's understanding of bees and insects in general is quite limited; and often influenced by labels on pest control products or tag lines on buzz feed articles. Few Vermonter are able to correctly identify more than one or two bee genera and honey bees are nearly always conflated with native species, even among fruit farmers and conservation practitioners. This combination of enthusiasm and lack of knowledge presents an exciting opportunity for education and outreach to have a meaningful impact. Policy makers, researchers, landowners, and even consumers all have a role to play in determining the future of Vermont’s bees. Increasing awareness of the incredible bee diversity and introduction to some of the nuisance in bee conservation will be crucial to get the public buy-in and the support necessary to improve the state of Vermont’s bees.
