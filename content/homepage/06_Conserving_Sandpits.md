Active and recently abandoned sandpits are home to perhaps the greatest concentration of rare and unusual bees. They are also rarely conserved and their existence on the landscape is largely dependent on the financial considerations of the many different owners and operators. Well-intended solar projects that cap and seed abandon sandpits could quickly remove a significant portion of the nesting habitat for a number of sand obligates. A conservation mechanism that allows for the continued and regulated extraction of sand while providing financial stability for all stakeholders would go a long way to securing the future of these bees and other sand-associated taxa (Sand Martins, Tiger Beetles, etc).
