<h4> 
Among the roughly 125 species known from New England, but not yet recorded in Vermont, are a number of rare species that would be of high conservation priority if they do occur here
</h4>
</div>

<b>Macropis Cuckoo Bee</b> (<i>Epeoloides pilosula</i>) and <i>Macropis ciliata</i> are both Loosestrife associated species that have been found recently at several sites in Massachusetts. Whorled Loosestrife (Lysimachia quadrifolia) on dry, hot powerline ROWs would be the most likely habitat for Macropis ciliata and any nest aggregation of Macropis could support the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, which is so rare it was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in the early 2000â€™s. 

In the same family with Macropis, the genus Melitta contains 3 specialists that are potentially in VT and of conservation concern. The Blueberry Blunt-horn (<i>Melitta americana</i>) is a specialist on cranberries (primarily American Cranberry - <i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>) while <i>Melitta eickworti</i> uses Deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i>) which is known from one site in SW VT on private land that was surveyed in 2021. The Lyonia Blunt-horn (Melitta melittoides) is a Lyonia specialist that is abundant at one site in VT near the Massachusetts border. Both the Blueberry Blunt-Horn and Lyonia Blunt-horn are hosts to Nomada rodecki. 

At least two mining bees are known from adjacent states and of conservation concern. Andrena uvulariae is a Bellwort specialist that should occur in VT, though could be easy to overlook given its small size. <i>Andrena rehni</i> is a Chestnut (<i>Castanea</i>) specialist that almost certainly was in Vermont before the arrival of chestnut blight, and may still occur in chestnut orchards or surviving wild trees.
